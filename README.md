# CPE311---CPE22S3
#Good Day! My name is John Martin Cabacungan, I'm 18 Years old and a CPE student in second year learning this course that is CPE311 - Computational Thinking with Python. My hobbies are singing and playing online games. When I first took this program which is CPE I was with my friend and he told me to take this course because he is taking the course he turn to pursue as well.
That's all for now and I hope that I will be able to pass this track elective course, These upcoming days of this course would help improve my learning.
